/**
 * File based configuration manager
 * You are tasked with creating a system-wide configuration manager for a complex software suite. The configuration manager is responsible for managing various configuration settings that affect the behavior and appearance of the software. To prevent multiple instances of the configuration manager, which could lead to inconsistencies and potential resource conflicts, you need to implement a design pattern that ensures the configuration manager is a singleton object.
